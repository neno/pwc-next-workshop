## The problem with React (and other JS Frameworks)

Like with all Javascript frameworks a React app is sent as a JS bundle from the server to the client. The browser then executes the Javascript and generates the app with all of its HTML pages.

This enables rich user experiences in the browsers. But this client-side approach comes also with a bunch of tradeoffs:

- Before the user can see or interact with the app the browser needs to download a lot of JS. And that takes time. But the longer the user needs to wait the worse the user experience gets
- A client-side generated app ships with no content except for a blank HTML skeleton. This is bad and extremely limiting for SEO (Search Engine Optimization)
